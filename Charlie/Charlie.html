        <h3>A little bit about Charlie</h3>
        <p>This is the place where you can be sure to find all of the info on the amazing
          Charlie Biscuit Shandrow. His favorite color is green and he loves food.
          He really likes to snuggle but only if he thinks its his idea.
          Sometimes he eats his feet which my parents dont like him doing but Im ok wiht it.
          Sometimes his feet just get itchy and he has no way of scratching them.
          You will know he is eating his feet whne you see it, its kinda hard to miss.
          He will also growl at you with a toy in his mouth but this means he is happy to see you.
          Anything you do he will love becayse he loves attenchion. I do require a photo sent
        to a member of the shandrow faimly everyday of the puppy.
        When he is put out side you have to tell him to be a good boy and if he was a good boy that Morning
      you can tell him he all ready is a good boy. he also drinks water like a horse to make sure he has water.
      He loves to go swimming so if you take him down to the water front and throw a stick into the water
    he will bring it back. He doesnt play fetch very well other than when swimming but im trying
  to get him to be better at it. He also loves riping up paper or cardboard boxes so if you having any extras
he will be soooo happy. I will also be updating this cite as time goes on.</p>
