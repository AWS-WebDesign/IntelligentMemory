<div class="Problem">
  <h1>Part Of The Problem</h1>
  <p>There are many companies such as Taylor Energy that have been dumping oil into the water.
    Taylor energy was an independent American oil company.
    They primarily drilled in the Gulf of Mexico off of the cost of Louisiana.
    One of their oil rigs were destroyed during hurricane Ivan in 2004 700 barrels of oil per day.
    Some people are saying that it stopped in 2014 making it be a 10-year old spill but others are saying it is ongoing still.
    Taylor Energy is not held responsible for the oil spill.
    They can get away with this by saying it was an act of god.
    This is a legal clause that means it was out of one's control and means they arenâ€™t held accountable for the events that have happened.
    Taylor Energy isn't the first oil company to use this term to get away with stuff.
  The reason why many people havent heard about instances like this is in the media big explosions and eye-catching events sell.
  This was a slow leak and did not cause an explosion so no media outlets found it worth covering and Taylor energy was trying to keep this out of media. </p>
