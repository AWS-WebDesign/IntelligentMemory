      <p>The oil is posisonous to animals from not only touching it but if they consume it.
        The oil can suffocate fish and also coat feathers or fur of other animals.
        This creates problems for them because it becomes hard to maintain their body tempature.
        <br>Cleanup operations if unprofessional can actually make the situation worse.
        The oil floats so it affects not only fish but sea otters and seabirds. There are two main types of oil.
         Light oil such as Gasoline and diesel can evaporate.
         While heavy oil typicaly from fuel ships or oil rigs contains crude oil.
         This type of oil if it resides long enough it can create health effects such as tumors.
         This type of oil can also catch on fire.</p>

    <div class="Problem">
      <h1>Part Of The Problem</h1>
      <p>There are many companies such as Taylor Energy that have been dumping oil into the water.
        Taylor energy was an independent American oil company.
        They primarily drilled in the Gulf of Mexico off of the cost of Louisiana.
        One of their oil rigs was destroyed during hurricane Ivan in 2004. Which resulted in the rig leaking 700 barrels of oil per day.
        Some people are saying that it stopped in 2014 making it be a 10-year old spill but others are saying it is ongoing still.
        Taylor Energy is not held responsible for the oil spill by claiming that it was an act of god.
        This is a legal clause that means it was out of one's control and means they aren’t held accountable for the events that have happened.
        Taylor Energy isn't the first oil company to use this term to get away with stuff.
        The reason why many people havent heard about instances like this is in the media big explosions and eye-catching events sell.
        This was a slow leak and did not cause an explosion so no media outlets found it worth covering and Taylor energy was trying to keep this out of media. </p>

  <div class="SOLVE">
    <h2>How To Solve This Problem</h2>
    <p>While there isnt a lot the average person can do to stop oil spills we need to work together and advocate for change.
      With the US pulling out of the Paris agreement in 2017 and global warming increasing we must demand change for the future.
      If everyone works together to create change it might be possible.
      We dont get a redo on earth we must strive to fix as much as we can and prevent further damage.</p>
