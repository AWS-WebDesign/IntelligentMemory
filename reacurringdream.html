<h1>Sleep Gobin</h1>
<h2>I have this dream where there is a slimy goblin with saggy skin that does not fill his body correctly. He has candy cane teeth that had started to dissove from his spit. Every night he tries to get me eat candy canes.</h2>
<h3>I always say now but one night I ask why he wants me to eat them</h3>
<h4>he says he used to be like me and he wants me to be just like him</h4>
<h5>the end</h5>
