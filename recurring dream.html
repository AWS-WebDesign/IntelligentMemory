<h1>Sleep Goblin</h1>
<h2>I have this recurring dream where a goblin creature that has slimey skin that is baggy like it doesnt really fit his body correctly.</h2>
<h3>He has sharp candy cane teeth that are starting to desolve but he keeps on trying to convice me to eat candy canes</h3>
<h4> I always say no but he keeps on trying to persuade me, i finnally ask him why he wants me to eat the candy canes</h4>
<h5>He says he was once like me and wants more friends</h5>
